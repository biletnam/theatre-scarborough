		<h2>SMTers On The Town</h2>
		<p>
			Like the sailors on 24 hour leave in the Broadway classic ON THE TOWN, SMTers are often out and about performing with other theatre groups. On this page we try to keep up with as many of our alumni as we can who are performing elsewhere. If you loved them on our stage, go and see what else they're doing! <small><i>(Note: Information presented is as current and accurate as possible.
