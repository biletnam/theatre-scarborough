			In this delightful comedy, the fundraising effort of the Women's Institute for a local hospital becomes a media sensation when the women create a nude calendar. Enjoy the hilarity and drama that ensues for these resourceful women as the calendar "goes viral"! Based on a true story and adapted from the Golden Globe Award winning film.
