			All his life, Scottie Templeton has avoided responsibility, misused his talents, disappointed his friends and family and wasted his money. When he is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, he won't stay serious long enough to accept treatment. Yet everyone who knows Scottie loves him, and when they arrange a public tribute for him some valuable truths are told. The role of Scottie was originally played on stage, and in the 1980 movie, by Jack Lemmon.<br>
