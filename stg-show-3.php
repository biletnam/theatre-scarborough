			Take one part Dashiell Hammett and one part the Bard of Avon, stir and pour onto the mean streets of London in 1605 and you have a classic cocktail of mayhem and mirth. Follow the adventures of hard-boiled detective Birnham Wood as he investigates his partner's murder and searches for the elusive Maltese Bodkin. By the writer who brought us <i>The Reluctant Resurrection of Sherlock Holmes</i>, this play was originally produced at the 1991 Edmonton Fringe Festival.
