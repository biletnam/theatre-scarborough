			Middle-aged baseball fanatic Joe Boyd trades his soul to the Devil for a chance to lead his favorite team to victory against the New York Yankees. Transformed into the young baseball sensation Joe Hardy, he turns the hapless Washington Senators around, only to realize the true worth of the life he's left behind. Light, fast-paced and devilishly clever, Damn Yankees is a home-run hit featuring an irreverent sense of humour that is musical comedy at its best. Winner of 7 Tony Awards including Best Musical, Damn Yankees thrills with songs such as <i>"Heart", "Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, MO", "Those Were the Good Old Days", and "Whatever Lola Wants."</i>
