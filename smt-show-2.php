			Winner of the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for Best Book of a Musical, The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee has charmed audiences with its effortless wit and humour. An eclectic group of six "tweenagers" vie for the spelling championship of a lifetime. Featuring a fast-paced, wildly funny and touching story and a truly fresh and vibrant score, these kids spell their way through the competition hoping to never hear the soul-crushing, pout-inducing, life un-affirming "ding" of the dreaded bell. At least the losers get a juice box. Be sure to brush up on your spelling before you go!
