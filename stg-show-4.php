			It is every parent's worst nightmare come true. The son and heir to the family business of the Winters of Hampstead has turned his back on tradition. He wants to abandon a time-honoured career passed down through many generations - a career in larceny - all because he has fallen in love with a beautiful young woman! Perhaps crime does not pay, but this felonious family will certainly provide hours of priceless entertainment, though not exactly in the tradition of the great English dramas!
