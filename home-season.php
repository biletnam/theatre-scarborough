					<h3>The World Goes Round</h3>
					<p>
						Music by John Kander<br>
						Lyrics by Fred Ebb<br>
						Conceived by Susan Stroman and David Thompson and Scott Ellis
					</p>
					<p>
						Kander and Ebb, two of musical theatre's greatest collaborators, have changed the face of Broadway with shows like Cabaret, Chicago, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Curtains, and The Scottsboro Boys. The World Goes 'Round collects some of their best loved works into an eclectic collection of love songs, torch songs, and acerbically witty comic numbers. In his New York Times review, Frank Rich wrote "The revue is sophisticated enough to satisfy aficionados like myself, … and welcoming enough to convert new audiences to the Kander-Ebb fold." Join us as we celebrate the musical success of Kander and Ebb.

					<h3>Picnic</h3>
					<p>
						by William Inge
					</p>
					<p>
						It is Labour Day, and everyone is preparing for a neighborhood picnic! Into the fold comes a stranger and emotions are ignited among the townsfolk. Blending strong drama with moments of bright comedy, this eloquent Pulitzer Prize winning play explores the lives of "ordinary" Mid-Western Americans, from hopeful widows and an embittered spinster to idealistic teenagers and a restless wanderer. The play was first performed on Broadway in 1953 and was adapted into a successful movie in 1955, starring William Holden and Kim Novak.

					<h3>Enchanged April</h3>
					<p>
						by Matthew Barber<br>
						from the novel by Elizabeth von Arnim
					</p>
					<p>
						"To those who appreciate wisteria and sunshine… and who have ever hoped, on occasion, that a little Enchantment might step in…" Set in 1922 London, Enchanted April is a charming comedy about four women who find their lives at a cross-roads. Leaving behind their inattentive husbands and humdrum lives, they embark on a spur-of-themoment, month long escape to a rented castle in Genoa, and dare to let a little Enchantment step in. What they get is much more than they expected, and the result is a beautiful experience that the LA Times calls a 'rarity, a play where every single element falls perfectly into place – a show that leaves you positively glowing.'

					<h3>9 to 5: The Musical</h3>
					<p>
						Music and Lyrics by Dolly Parton<br>
						Book by Patricia Resnick<br>
						Based on the 20th Century Fox Picture
					</p>
					<p>
						With a Tony Award nominated score by Dolly Parton, this stage adaptation of the 1980 film is the hilarious story of friendship and revenge in the Rolodex era. Pushed to the boiling point, three female co-workers concoct a plan to get even with the sexist, hypocritical misogynist who is their boss. Outrageous, thought-provoking, and even a little bit romantic, 9 to 5 is about teaming up and taking care of business that is sure to delight anyone who has ever tumbled out of bed and stumbled to the kitchen to pour themselves a cup of ambition before punching the clock to make a living.

					<h3>The Mumberley Inheritance</h3>
					<p>
						by Warren Graves
					</p>
					<p>
						What fun it is to boo and hiss as the piano player goes wild in this fast paced entertaining romp. This music-filled madcap melodramatic comedy in the Victorian tradition not only comes complete with the dastardly villain, the virtuous damsel in distress, and the hero who saves the day, but also provides ample opportunity for audience interaction. This winner of the Samuel French Challenge Award for "Best Canadian Production" is a proven crowd pleaser.

					<h3>Key for Two</h3>
					<p>
						by John Chapman and Dave Freeman
					</p>
					<p>
						Harriet, a divorcée living in an elegant flat in Brighton, has financial problems that need tending to. What better way to solve them than to "entertain" two married men simultaneously? ("Not at the same time," She's quick to point out.) Her plan soon begins to hilariously unravel when her friend Anne arrives unexpectedly, in hot pursuit by her drunken husband, followed not soon after by two irate wives looking for their husbands. Written by two masters of British farce, Key for Two is comic magic that you won't want to miss.
